chef
====

Chef configurations for RingBase.

Requirements
==

Install `chef` and `knife` on your machine.

Make sure to also run `bundle install` for the gems.

When installing cookbooks with `berks` run the command `berks intall --path cookbooks`
so that the cookbooks install directly into the cookbooks directory.
